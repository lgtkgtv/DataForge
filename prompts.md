Now, please create a step by step tutorial to teach module 1. I like concise documents. So use comments when introducing very important concepts, otherwise please provide complete code examples and command .


In these tutorials, i will like you to suggest `project names`, Application name, and `files names and C code examples. Assume i am using linux, llvm/clang compiler, cmake builds.
